            <h2>The Milky Way Galaxy</h2>
            <p>Did you know that our star, the Sun, is just one of hundreds of billions of stars swirling within an enormous cosmic place called the Milky Way Galaxy? The Milky Way is a huge collection of stars, dust and gas. It’s called a spiral galaxy because if you could view it from the top or bottom, it would look like a spinning pinwheel...</p>

            <p>If we could travel outside our galaxy and look back, this is what our Milky Way Galaxy might look like from above. An artist created this illustration using data collected by astronomers...</p>

            <h2>Galaxy Shape and Structure</h2>
            <p>If you could see our galaxy from the side, it would look like a huge, thin disk with a slight bump in the center. This flat shape is caused by the galaxy spinning around. Everything in our spinning galaxy would fly off into space if it weren’t for the force of gravity...</p>

            <h2>Stars in the Milky Way</h2>
            <p>Without a telescope, we can see about 6,000 stars from Earth. That may seem like a lot of stars, but it’s actually only a small part of the whole. If you think of the entire galaxy as a giant pizza, all the stars you can see from Earth fall within about one pepperoni on that pizza...</p>

            <h2>Q&A with Astronomer Julianne Dalcanton</h2>
            <p><strong>Are all galaxies like the Milky Way?</strong></p>
            <p>No. Galaxies come in lots of different sizes. Smaller ones have millions of stars, while bigger ones contain billions. Galaxies also have different shapes. Some are spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way. Some are egg-shaped elliptical galaxies, and the rest are called irregular galaxies...</p>

            <img class="galaxy-images" src="spiral_galaxy.jpg" alt="Spiral Galaxy">

            <p><strong>What’s your favorite galaxy, and why?</strong></p>
            <p>I’m fond of the “Sombrero Galaxy” because it shows how “3-D” galaxies are. Most galaxies look like flat paintings in the sky, but with the Sombrero, you really get the impression that it’s this big THING sitting out there in space!...</p>

            <img class="galaxy-images" src="sombrero_galaxy.jpg" alt="Sombrero Galaxy">

            <p><strong>Is it fun being an astronomer?</strong></p>
            <p>Definitely. I often travel to interesting places like Hawaii and Chile. That’s because the best telescopes in the world are located on high mountains in remote places, where it’s dry and dark at night. When I need to study stars all night, I sometimes have to blast music to stay awake...</p>
